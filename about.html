        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>Founded in the spring of 1996, WUTV is Washington University’s student-run A/V production group. We support education and advancement for students seeking hands on experience in broadcast television and related industries, as well as for students who simply have an interest in film or television. In doing so, WUTV provides a venue for the student body of Washington University to explore their interests through original student programming and coverage of campus events viewable for free on Vimeo and Youtube.</p>
        <p>We also offer open sessions of hands-on technical training in all aspects of video production. Join us with no experience and leave us a capable camera operator, editor, or producer.</p>
        <p>We strive to promote creation and expression across the Washington University community. We, passionate creators, use audiovisual media with the intent to change, entertain, or thrill our viewers.</p>

                       While we’d love to film every event that every group has on campus, it’s just not logistically possible. We do often film events that we’d like to show on WUTV, or we can set you up with freelance student videographers who can film your event for a small production fee, so it never hurts to ask. If we can’t, we do rent equipment so that you can film your own event. <br>

Feel free to drop by one of our weekly meetings (Saturday at 1pm in the Harvey Media Center) and let us know that you’d like to get involved. You can also feel free to drop us a message so we can chat with you in advance (and to make sure we’re having a meeting this week).

                        WUTV offers an invaluable opportunity for students interested in careers in broadcasting and video-production (or just looking to have a good time playing with cameras) to get hands on experience. Recent WUTV alumni have gone on to work on such shows as <em>Good Morning America</em>, <em>Fear Factor</em>, and <em>Invasion</em>.

                        We currently have 14 Executive Board officers, and our weekly meetings vary in size, sometimes just the execs and a few showrunners, sometimes upwards of 50. Additionally, there are tons of students who get involved in an odd project here and there, and we work with members of other student groups on their projects from time to time as well. Between all of our current productions, there are tons of students affiliated with WUTV in some capacity!
